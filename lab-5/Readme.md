**Video Demonstrates 2 Thread Groups**

**1st Thread Group includes** testing HTTP post request for articles. 

It also shows using Once Only Controller to run the Login API once and then extract the Token from it using Post Processor - Json Extractor.

Token is kept in the variable at HTTP Header Manager which is further utilised by the Add Article HTTP request to be an authorized request by the logged in user.

Three types of Listeners are added - Result Tree, Summary Report and Graph Results.



**2nd Thread Group includes** testing registration of 30 users.

Reading Data from CSV and registering the users
